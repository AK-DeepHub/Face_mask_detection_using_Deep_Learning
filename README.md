# Face_mask_detection_using_Deep_Learning

## About Test Folder:

	This folder consist some varying realtime examples of person with and without mask.

## Basic aim of the project is detect the person in images and videos and then classifying it with label mask and without_mask.

## In this repo we will be posting some transfer learning models with their pretrained weight on "Imagenet" dataset and some customised top layers whose weights will be trained.

## We will also adding models which are fully customised with some heuristics for better accuracy and parameters of all the layers of model will trained.

## After training we will use that model for our prediction on images and videos.
